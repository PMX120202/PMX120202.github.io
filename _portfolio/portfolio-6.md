## An Interpretable Model for Spatio-Temporal Traffic Forecasting
### Abstract:
Traffic forecasting is the process of estimating traffic flow on roads and intersections within a transportation system. The goal of this prediction is to provide detailed and accurate information about traffic conditions, helping urban management and drivers make informed decisions. In the past decade, traffic forecasting methods have rapidly evolved, especially with the expansion of artificial intelligence. Additionally, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to address the challenge of making machine learning models more transparent and interpretable. In the context of traffic forecasting, model transparency is crucial for enhancing trust among the community and users. XAI in traffic prediction enables interpretability of the modeling and forecasting processes, helping users understand why a specific prediction is made.

Recognizing this issue, this thesis proposes a Beats-ODE model for traffic forecasting, integrating N-Beats blocks and the MTGODE submodule to improve predictive performance. In this model, stacked convolutional ODE blocks are employed to learn temporal features, while graph convolutional ODE blocks are used to capture spatial characteristics. The use of ODE allows continuous information flow between layers, enhancing model accuracy. Additionally, we integrate a traffic forecasting module with an explainability module based on mask optimization for regression tasks. This approach increases user trust in the model, as they can analyze key contributing factors and understand the reasoning behind specific predictions.

Furthermore, we conducted experiments to evaluate our modelâ€™s accuracy against state-of-the-art methods on two datasets: METR-LA and PEMS-BAY. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms existing baseline methods.
