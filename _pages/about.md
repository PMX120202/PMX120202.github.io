I'm a Data Engineer / Machine Learning Engineer with a strong passion for data-driven solutions and AI innovation.

🎓 I graduated from the University of Sciences (HCMUS) with a major in Data Science, where I developed a deep understanding of machine learning, big data processing.

💻 Currently, I specialize in building scalable data pipelines and chatbot. I enjoy working with complex datasets, designing efficient architectures, and solving real-world problems through technology.

🌱 I'm always eager to explore new advancements in AI, deep learning, and big data. Whether it's experimenting with the latest ML frameworks, fine-tuning large language models, or implementing cutting-edge cloud solutions, I thrive on innovation.

🚀 I'm open to collaborations on exciting projects involving data science, AI research, and software development. If you're working on something challenging and impactful, I'd love to be a part of it!

🔍 When I'm not coding or analyzing data, you’ll find me exploring new technologies, reading AI research papers, or sharing knowledge with the tech community.
